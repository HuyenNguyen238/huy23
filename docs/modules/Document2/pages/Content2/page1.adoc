If any of your content repositories are private, you can define a GIT_CREDENTIALS CI/CD variable that holds the credentials to give Antora access to those repositories in this environment. You can set up deploy tokens in your content repository to give the CI/CD pipeline in your playbook project (and thus Antora) read-only access to those repositories.
